    "# Leven at Newby Bridge using HBV model in eWaterCycle\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how eWaterCycle is used to run a model, in this case the classic HBV model, with forcing from the Caravan dataset. The only difference with the previous notebook is that here we use a \"local\" version of HBV, so HBV is not run inside of a container. This greatly speeds up the performance, but is less 'Reproducible' because now the results depend (more) on the setting / python version / dependcies of the local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we chose a catchment in the Lake District in the UK. River discharge in river Leven is measured at the weirs at Newby Bridge, see the photo below. This observational data is available through the CamelsGB dataset [(Coxon, 2020)](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/2459/2020/).\n",

    "- apptainer, a container engine that runs the model-containers (Docker is supported too).\n",
    "- [ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool), a climate data processing toolbox that originally intended to post-process climate data from CMIP projects for inclusion in IPCC reports, we adopted as tool for pre-processing climate data into forcing data for hydrological models\n",
    "- Numerous hydrological models that are made available as plugins to eWaterCycle, see [eWaterCycle-leakybucket](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-leakybucket) as an example. Note that plugins do not have to be owned and maintained by the eWaterCycle team: anyone with a model can make a plugin for eWaterCycle and make their model be available for others through the platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, eWaterCycle requires forcing data, obsrvational data and parameter sets to be available to users. If you want to install eWaterCycle on your own infrastructure, see the [eWaterCycle documentation](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system_setup.html) or contact us."

    "The HBV model is a lumped hydrological model. It considers a catchment as a homogenious area and calculates the major hydrological processes in it. It requires spatially aggregated rainfall and potential evaporation as inputs (ie. forcings). To calculate its modelled discharge at the outlet of the catchment it also needs a set of parameters. Usually these paramters are calibrated using (historical) observational data, so this is also required. \n",

    "in eWaterCycle we provide access to the Caravan dataset, which contains all of the above data for all the catchments in the different Camels datasets. In this notebook we use the precipitation and evaporation data from Caravan. However, there is a known problem with the caravan evaporation data and (the current version) shouldn't be used. In this notebook we do so to demonstrate how it works. It would be better to generate forcing from (for example) ERA5. [This](example_model_run_HBV_camels_catchment_ERA5_forcing.ipynb) additional notebook that looks very similar to this one explains how to do that. \n",
