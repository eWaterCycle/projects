The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done by the Editors. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified within the book either at the bottom of the first page in a chapter, or at the bottom of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular page, it is by the Editors.


## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a JupyterBook that is written using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. 
Additional tooling is used from the [TeachBooks initiative](https://teachbooks.io/) to enhance the editing and reading experience. 
The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/projects/tree/main). 
The website can be viewed at https://www.ewatercycle.org/projects/main/intro.html. 
View the repository README file or contact the authors for additional information.
