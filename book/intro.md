## eWaterCycle

The [eWaterCycle](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Python package brings together many components from the eWaterCycle project. 
An overall goal of this project is to make hydrological modelling fully reproducible, open, and FAIR.

Typically, the eWaterCycle platform is deployed on a system that can be accessed through the browser via JupyterHub, and comes preconfigured with readily available parameter sets, meteorological forcing data, model images, etcetera. 
This makes it possible for researchers to quickly run an experiment without the hassle of installing a model or creating suitable input data. 
To learn more about the system setup, read our [System setup](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system_setup.html) page.
