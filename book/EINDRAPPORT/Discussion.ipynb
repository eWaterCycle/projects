    "This research aimed to investigate the impact of predicted climate change on the hydrology fo the Wien River and implications for flooding of the adjacent U4 subway line. The analysis focussed on determining the flooding threshold, estimating the current frequency of threshold exceedance, and projecting future frequency of exceedance under different climate change scenarios.

    "In Chapter 2, the critical discharge at which the U4 subway line is expected to flood is determined to be at a mean value of 530 or 534 m3/s. These thresholds are based on studies by Faber (2006) and Compton et al. (2009), who determined that overtopping is the primary mechanism leading to flooding, rather than stuctural failure of the floodwall. Given that the threshold values are normally distributed, overtopping could happen with a probability of 5 % at discharge values of 510 and 511 m3/s, or with a 95% probability of actually causing overtopping at discharge values of 557 and 550 m3/s.
