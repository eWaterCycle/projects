# Tutorials and examples

This chapter lists a number of example analyses designed by the eWaterCycle community to 

- Highlight the different potential uses of eWaterCycle in hydrological research
- Provide a starting point for researchers to start doing their own analyses
- Showcase best practices in designing and documenting Open and FAIR hydrological modelling analyses

The examples are:

## Straightforward model runs
- Running the HBV model on a region from the Caravan dataset using input data from ERA5.
- Running the PCRGlobWB model on a region from the Caravan dataset using input data from ERA5.

## Model calibration
- calibrating the HBV model on a region from the Caravan dataset using input data from ERA5 and observations from the Caravan dataset.
