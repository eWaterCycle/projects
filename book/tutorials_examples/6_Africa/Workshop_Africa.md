# Workshop Africa

Welcome to the **eWaterCycle** Africa workshop!

This is the 2nd part for the eWatercycle workshops for Ghana, Kenya & Zimbabwe.

Again: first you will choose your catchment in notebook 1, where you can still calibrate it yourself!
Then we move to known calibration methods
After this we can use the calibrated model to do research with future climate models.
This will be done in notebooks 2(a,b,c)!
They are split up to improve the workflow.
