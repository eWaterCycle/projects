# Workshop Africa

Welcome to the **eWaterCycle** Africa workshop!

This is the 2nd part for the eWatercycle workshops for Ghana, Kenya & Zimbabwe.

Again: first you will choose your catchment in notebook 1, where you can still calibrate it yourself!
Then we move to known calibration methods and use those to a climate impact analysis.
