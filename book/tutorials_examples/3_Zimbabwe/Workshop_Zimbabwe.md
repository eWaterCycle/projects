# Workshop Zimbabwe

Welcome to the **eWaterCycle** Zimbabwe workshop!

This is part of a 3-hour workshop where you will be doing your own future research on your catchment of choice for Zimbabwe!

First you will choose your catchment in notebook 1, where you will also calibrate it yourself!
After this we can use the calibrated model to do research with future climate models.
This will be done in notebooks 2(a,b,c)!
They are split up to improve the workflow.
