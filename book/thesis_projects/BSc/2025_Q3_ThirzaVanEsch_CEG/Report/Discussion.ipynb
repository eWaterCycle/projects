(2009), who determined that overtopping is the primary mechanism leading to flooding, rather than stuctural failure of the floodwall. Given that the threshold values are normally distributed, overtopping could happen with a probability of $5 \\%$ at discharge values of $510$ and $511$ $m^3 / s$, or with a $95 \\%$ probability of actually causing overtopping at discharge values of $557$ and $550$ $m^3 / s$."

    "If the return periods under the different climate change scenarios are compared to the current return period of the threshold value, it can be seen that only SSP119 results in a higher return period. The rest of the climate change scenarios all result in a lower return period and thus a higher frequency of flooding of the U4 subway line. A shocking outcome is the return period of scenario SSP126, this is a sustainability scenario, but results in a lower return period than the current return period. This means that increased floodrisk is likely even with climate mitigation efforts. "

    "The findings of this research have significant implications for the urban flood risk management in Vienna. The increasing frequency of extreme discharges increases the risk of flooding of the U4 subway line. The Wien River is currently designed to withstand a discharge with a return period of 1000 years, but in reality the Wien Rivers flooding threshold currently has a return period of 641 years. Under four of the five investigated climate change projections this return period of flooding will only decrease. This means that the current flood protection infrastucture of the Wien River is insufficient to realize the designed return period for flooding of 1000 years, and needs reinforcement."

    "While this research provides a valuable assessment of future flood risk of the U4 subway line, some limitations must be acknowledged. First of all, the observed data covers only a period of about 40 years and does not contain a discharge as high as the threshold value, resulting in the need for extrapolation. This means that estimating the return periods for extreme discharges relies on statistical extrapolation, introducing the risk for potential errors.\\\n",
    "The data only being available for a period of around 40 years also influences the parameter calibration. The calibration period contains peaks, but the validation period does not. This causes the model to overestimate the amount of peaks in the validation period. It is decided to choose the calibration and validation periods like this, and not to alter them. Altering them, so choosing a calibration period with the period without peaks, causes the model to underestimate the amount of peaks in the validation period. Overestimating peaks is more 'safe' than underestimating peaks. It is important to consider that the model is calibrated on a limited period of data, and it is uncertain how representative this data is.\\\n",
    "Furthermore, the HBV model, like all hydrological models, is a simplification of reality. The model has inherent uncertainties caused by the parameter calibration, data quality and simplification in the representation of the catchment area and the inherent physical processes.\\\n",
    "The use of climate projections also brings its uncertainties. Climate models are biased, they are focussed on perfecting the energy balance. This means they are not focussed on specifically the waterbalance. Projections for precipitation may thus not be as good as temperature projections. Furthermore, in this research only one of the 25 ensemblemembers of the MPI model is used because of a lack of time. Other ensemblemembers could give other projections that result in different return periods. Using all the 25 ensemblemembers would reduce uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the research provides a good understanding of the future flood risks under different climate change scenarios, and highlights the need for action in urban flood protection infrastucture."

    "To improve the accuracy and applicabilty of flood risk assessment of the Wien River, future studies should consider using all the 25 ensemblemembers of the MPI climate model. In this way uncertainty is reduced, and the results of the return period calculations will be more reliable.\\\n",
    "Furthermore, the flood protection infrastucture can be investigated. Due to the time limitation of this research this could not be done, but it would be of great relevance to investigate the current flood protection infrastructure of the Wien River and look for where and what reinforcements can be applied."
