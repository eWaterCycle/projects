# Preface

To complete my bachelor's program in Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of
Technology (TU Delft), I had to write a thesis on a subject of interest. Among all the topics covered in
my studies, hydrology stood out as the one I enjoyed the most. Additionally, climate change is a subject
I find increasingly important in today's world, which led me to choose the topic: "Impact of Climate
Change on a River of Choice."

With Europe experiencing significant changes due to climate change, I knew I wouldnâ€™t have to look far
to find a suitable river for my research. After reading about the record-breaking droughts in France, it
became clear that the Loire River would be a perfect case study. Its hydrological challenges in the face
of climate change make it a compelling subject for analysis.

For further insight into the methods used to analyse drought, the complete repository for this research
