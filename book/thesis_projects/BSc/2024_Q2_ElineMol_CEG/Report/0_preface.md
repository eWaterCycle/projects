# Preface

Before you lies the bachelor thesis on “The Impact of Climate Change on Groundwater Recharge in
the Sonoran Desert”, which is written for the course ‘Bachelor Eindwerk’ (CTB3000-16). This
thesis fulfils one of the graduation requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering
at Delft University of Technology.

The topic of climate change has been a subject of interest throughout my studies. Therefore, it was
clear that this is a topic I want to research. In exploring areas I want to focus on, I was drawn to
the Sonoran Desert. This region is characterized by its arid climate and impending water shortage.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors dr. ir. R. Hut and ir. V. Hoogelander
for guiding me and providing support throughout this research. Their knowledge on hydrological
systems and the hydrological models in eWaterCycle helped me navigate through this project.
Additionally, I would like to thank Bart from the eScience Center for providing technical assistance
during this project.
