    "The HBV model requires inputs which are retrieved from the ERA5 data set. ERA5 is a global climate reanalysis data set made available by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather  Forecasts (ECMWF). The data estimates a range of climate related variables needed for the HBV model from 1940 to the present (Hersbach et al., 2020). The HBV model uses the ERA5 generated precipitation, surface air temperature and shortwave radiation for the catchment area. The potential evapotranspiration is calculated by applying the Makkink equation to the generated ERA5 forcings. The generated ERA5 data appeared to have some corruptions in the period from 1988 to 1992. To avoid large variations in the calibrated HBV model, the ERA5 data is linearly interpolated at the location of these outliers. The initial ERA5 generated forcings and the interpolated results are shown in Figure 3.2 and 3.3 respectively."

    "Using this parameter set, the HBV model is run for the calibration and validation period. The initial results are graphed in Figure 3.4. The Figure shows an unrealistic peak in discharge around 1990, including distortions of the model around that time period. As mentioned, this indicates there may be a fault in the ERA5 forcing data that is disproportionately influencing the HBV model. To get a better visualisation of the model accuracy, the data period from 09 January 1987 until 09 May 1992 is stricken from the data. It is chosen to keep the short data period before 1987 because it means having extra data points in the result analysis to determine the return periods of droughts. Figure 3.5 shows the simulated and observed discharge without this period. The model shows a slight underestimation of peak discharges. However, the dry periods are simulated accurately which is critical for the research question. Overall, the calibrated model demonstrates a good ability to simulate the discharge also for the validation period. "
