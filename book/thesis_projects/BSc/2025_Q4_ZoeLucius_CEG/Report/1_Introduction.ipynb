    "Climate change is devastating the world at an alarming rate. Coming decennia there is an expected increase in frequency and/or severity of weather extremes and natural disasters. All of this is likely to have devastating effects for the livelihoods of people globally. The manner in which climate change will impact an area varies greatly per region. Where some regions are expected to experience droughts of extreme durations and deficits, others expect an increase in extreme percipitation and floods, and others yet an increase in the severity of both (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, particular regions are more vulnerable than others due to a limited capacity in managing the impacts of climate change. In 2022, 15 of the 20 countries ranked lowest in the ND-GAIN Country Index were African countries. This index is based on vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change on food, water, health, ecosystems, human habitats, and infrastructure security as well as a countries governmental, economic and social readiness to respond to climate change (University of Notre Dame, 2022). Although Africa is highly vulnerable to climate variability it has contributed relatively little to global CO$_2$ emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (2022), Africa accounts for only about 4% of global CO$_2$ emissions while being home to 19% of the worlds population (statista, 2025). \n",

    "The impacts of extended periods of drought followed by heavy rains and tropical cyclones affect thousands of peoples livelihoods (Africa Suffers Disproportionately From Climate Change, 2023). The research is therefore of great relevance to contribute to knowledge on climate resilience of existing infrastructure in the worldâ€™s second largest continent with an expected exponential growth in the coming decennia."

    "Through literature studies, a pressing climate-induced issue that quickly came to light is the drought faced in Southern and Eastern Africa in the rain season of 2023/2024 (Drought Worsens Crisis in Southern Africa, 2024). The Zambezi basin, located on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe was hit particularly hard. Besides being a huge water reserve used for agricultural purposes and by the surrounding communities, the basin feeds into the Kariba dam on which both Zambia and Zimbabwe are heavily reliant for power generation. A prolonged drought can leave large parts of both countries  without electricity for days on end, with the effects being socially and economically detrimental. These climate extremes, such as prolonged droughts can be expected to become more frequent as a result of climate change. A proper understanding of just how much more frequent is crucial to be able to better mitigate these challenges in the future.\n"
