    "To simulate historic discharge, the HBV model is run with the same calibrated parameters, this time using CMIP6 forcings as input. The modelled discharge compared to the observed data is shown in Figure 5.1. The HBV modelled streamflow with CMIP6 forcings shows no extreme outliers in the period around 1990, verifying that there is most likely a discrepancy in the ERA5 data and not in the parameters determined in the calibration. The HBV model with CMIP6 forcings shows a good understanding of the Zambezi discharge at Katima Mulilo. "

    "The plot shows that the modelled CMIP6 forcings are not yet simulating the observed return periods well. To correct the apparent bias in the model, quantile mapping is used. Quantile mapping is the method of replacing each modelled value with its equivalent percentile value in the observed data. A function is made to describe the mapping that takes place. Assuming the biases in the model are constant, modelled return periods for the future climate scenarios are scaled to the same quantile levels using this function. The outcome of the corrected historic return period is depicted also in Figure 5.2.  The process used for developing the quantile mapping function is provided in Appendix D."
