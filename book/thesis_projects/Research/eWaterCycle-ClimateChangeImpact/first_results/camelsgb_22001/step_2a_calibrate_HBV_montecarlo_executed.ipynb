    "# Calibrating HBV hydrological model run locally outside container forced with ERA5 forcing data\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate how to calibrate the HBV model and works as an example of how to calibrate models in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an extention to eWaterCycle: eWaterCycle-DA with DA for Data Assimilation. This package, developed by former MSc student David Haasnoot, adds functionality to deal with ensembles of models in eWaterCycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do now run into a bit of a chicken and egg problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- calibration of a model needs to be done before running the actual model experiment.\n",
    "- it is better to first demonstrate how to run a model before calibrating. But this requires calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, too understand how models are run, please have a look at the [step 3 notebook](step_3a_model_run_historical.ipynb) first before reading on. "

    "## Calibration basics and objective function\n",
    "In model calibration, we are looking for a set of parameters such that when the model is run with that set of parameters, we get the best model output. What \"best\" means differs per application or research question. In general, we like some model outputs to be as close as possible to observations. For this purpose we create an objective function that takes the model output of interest and observations as inputs and calculates some score that shows goodness of fit. Here we use a RMS difference function:"
