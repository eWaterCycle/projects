# Seamless

eWaterCycle Seamless is a workflow in the making with the intent of improving accessibility for regular users to super computers.
This workflow will contain no command line and is all done within Python Notebooks.

The idea for this example is:
1. Make a workflow that works for one region from the Caravan CAMELS dataset.
2. Make minor adjustments to said workflow for every region you want to look at.
3. Push workflow to any SLURM based HPC.
4. Pull executed notebooks and/or results back per region and analyse.
